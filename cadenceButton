/*
*Thanks Arvind Sanjeev for the code
*This is a basic cadance sensor that holds down a button for as long as you cadence is above a certain speed.
*My long term goal with this is to have it setup to look at speed, cadance, power(maybe to expensive), have have it
work with a more modern controller.
